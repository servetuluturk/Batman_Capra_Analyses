# Wild Goat Spatial Analyses – Batman Province

This repository contains R scripts and data used to analyze wild goat (*Capra aegagrus*)
populations in Batman Province, Türkiye.

## Methods
The study integrates the following analytical approaches:
- Line Transect Distance Sampling (LTDS)
- Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)
- Euclidean Distance Analysis (EDA)

## Repository Structure
- `scripts/` – R scripts for LTDS, KDE, and EDA analyses
- `data/` – CSV files including sample, observation, and region tables

## Data Availability
CSV data required for distance sampling analyses are provided.
Raster datasets used in KDE analyses are not publicly shared due to data size and policy constraints.
